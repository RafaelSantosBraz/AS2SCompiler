# Runtime

Here we have some simple tests for the framework.

* See the "examples" folder for Java and C source codes.

* The Tmaps folder contains all the tmaps (Translation Maps) needed to execute the conversions 'Java to C' and 'C to Java'. See tmap language and interpreter descriptions [here](https://github.com/RafaelSantosBraz/AS2SCompiler/tree/master/TranslationMapInterpreter). Of course you can extend the maps if you need to.
