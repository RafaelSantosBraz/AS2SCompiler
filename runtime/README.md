# Runtime

Here we have some simple tests for the framework. 

* See the "examples" folder for Java and C source codes.

* The Tmaps folder contains all the tmaps (Translation Maps) needed to execute the conversions 'Java to C' and 'C to Java'. See tmap language and interpreter descriptions [here](https://github.com/RafaelSantosBraz/AS2SCompiler/tree/master/TranslationMapInterpreter). Of course you can extend the maps if you need to.

* The 'compC.sh' and 'compJava.sh' files are just bash commands to automatically test the compiler and its outputs.

    * Change the paths on the '.sh' files to test your own folders or place your code in the 'runtime/input' to execute it normally.
