# eCST Adapter

The eCST Adapter project deals with the process of adapting the elements of a given eCST generated from a programming language X into elements of eCST of another programming language Y, for example, elements of a C eCST converted into elements of Java eCST. In this scenario, it would ne possible to convert a "const" C node into a "final" Java node and lots of other changes.

Currently, there are [those](https://github.com/RafaelSantosBraz/AS2SCompiler/tree/master/eCSTAdapter/src/adapters) adapters in this project:

* C eCST to java eCST.
* Java eCST to C eCST.
